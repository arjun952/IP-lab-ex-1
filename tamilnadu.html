<h1> TAMILNADU </h1>
<p>The State of <b>Tamil Nadu</b> has a hoary antiquity. Though early sangam classics throw historical references, we pass to recorded history only from the Pallavas.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the major occupation in Tamilnadu. The total cultivated area in the State was <b>56.10 million </b>hectares in 2007-08. The principal food crops include paddy, millets and pulses. Commercial crops include sugarcane, cotton, sunflower, coconut, cashew, chillies, gingelly and groundnut. Plantation crops are tea, coffee, cardamom and rubber. Major forest produces are timber, sandalwood, pulp wood and fuel wood. Tamilnadu occupies a premier position in the production and extensive application of bio-fertilizers.
